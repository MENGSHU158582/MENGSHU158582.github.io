The Shakespware Papers are sniopets of amsuing,tantalizing,peculiar,educative,unexpected,surpsing,brilliant,intriguing,and occasionally controversial tidbits about the Shakespearean plays andsonnets.

Each brautifully  designed ,full-color,bimonthly,16-page boodlet focuses on one tiny aspect of these luminous works.Why,you ask?

There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper!
